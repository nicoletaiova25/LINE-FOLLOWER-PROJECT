    <h2> Description ðŸ¥¥ </h2>
  </summary>
 Our Malibu team teamed up for an exciting project â€“ creating a smart robot known as a line follower ( Zambila ). The three of us carefully crafted this cool robot. 
 Our main goal? To make a robot that could follow a black line on a different-colored surface all on its own. The challenge was to guide it through a set path and finish in under 20 seconds. We nailed it by combining sensors, precise building, and clever programming. Our line follower not only met the tough requirements but also showcased the awesome skills and teamwork within the Malibu crew!

     <h3> Design ðŸ¥¥ </h3>
  </summary>
    
  ðŸŒ´ Our line follower's setup is pretty cool and practical. We used an Arduino Uno Board as the brain, hooked up to a DIY chassis that we cut ourselves to fit two DC motors. These motors run on a LiPo battery, giving our robot the power it needs.

ðŸŒ´ To keep it on track, we installed a QTR-8A reflectance sensor and fixed it in place with screws. The wheels help it move around smoothly, and we added a ball caster for balance.

ðŸŒ´  We kept things tidy with female-male wires for the line sensor and used a medium-sized breadboard for connections. The L293D motor driver takes care of the motor functions, and zip-ties keep everything neat.

ðŸŒ´ We got a bit creative with the design, giving our robot a personalized touch by adding a custom chassis with the license plate "PH 13 ZBN." We named it 'Zambila' and went for a Californian vibe to match our Malibu team's spirit. So, our line follower not only works great but also looks pretty cool!

     <h2> Best time ðŸŒ´ </h2>
  </summary>
  That's awesome! Zambila's best time was around 18.24 seconds, if I remember correctly. It surprised us so much that it worked so well that we didn't even get a chance to film it in action. The excitement of seeing it perform brilliantly took us by surprise! ðŸš—âœ¨
